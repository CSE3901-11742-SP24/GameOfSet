Game Of Set

This is a Ruby implementation of the classic card game "Set". The game is played between a player and a computer, where the goal is to identify sets of cards from a grid.


How to Play

Prerequisites

    Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system.

Setup

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    2. Navigate to the directory containing the code files.

Running the Game
To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:

	ruby main.rb

Gameplay

    1. The game will begin by dealing a set of cards onto the table.
    2. Each player takes turns to identify sets of three cards that meet specific criteria.
    3. Players can input the indices of the cards they believe form a set, or request a hint.
    4. The computer player also attempts to identify sets during its turn.
    5. The game continues until either the deck is empty or there are no more valid sets on the table.
    6. After the game ends, the final scores and statistics will be displayed.

Features

    Player interaction: Players can input their choices during their turn.
    Computer opponent: The computer player attempts to find sets based on a specified probability.
    Hint system: Players can request hints to help them find sets.
    Game statistics: After the game, various statistics are displayed, such as the total turns and sets found.

Simulation

Included in the code is a simulation module (SetGameSimulation) that allows running multiple game simulations to gather statistics on the probability of not finding a set with a given number of cards.

To run a simulation, modify the parameters in the SetGameSimulation initialization and execute the run_simulation method.
